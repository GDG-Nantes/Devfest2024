  Hi everyone, I'm Julien — a Fullstack JS Developer at SFEIR. I'm curious about new technologies and tools to make developers' life easier, always eager to learn. Currently exploring the world of Flutter to discover cross-platform development. 
  Beyond coding, you'll catch me playing RPG & Roguelike games, trying to learn how to play various music instruments, hiking and camping in the wild.
