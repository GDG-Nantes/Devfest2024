  Hi everyone, I'm Julien — an Engineering Manager and Fullstack JS Developer at SFEIR. I'm curious about new technologies and tools to make developers' life easier, always eager to learn. Currently exploring the world of Flutter to discover cross-platform development. 
  Beyond coding, you'll catch me playing RPG & Roguelike games, trying to learn how to play various music instruments, hiking and camping in the wild.
