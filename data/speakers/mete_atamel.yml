  I’m a Software Engineer and a Developer Advocate with 18+ years of experience. Currently, I work in the Developer Relations team at Google in London. I build tools, demos, tutorials, and give talks to educate and help developers to be successful on Google Cloud. As a regular speaker at tech conferences, I have spoken over 345+ events since 2016 on modern application development topics such as Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, serverless, event-driven architectures, and microservice orchestration. Prior to my current role, I was a Software Engineer/Architect/Tech Lead at Nokia, EMC, Adobe, Skype, and Microsoft building various client and server technologies, resulting in multiple patents.
