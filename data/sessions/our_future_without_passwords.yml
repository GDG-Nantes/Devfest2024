  Picture the future. What do you see? Flying cars? Vacations in space? How about…not having to use passwords anymore? Well, welcome to that future. The no passwords one, not flying cars.

  I’ll take you on a journey through our future where you can log in to a site or app by unlocking your phone and show you how to build your own authentication system using passkeys.

  Passkeys are a significantly safer replacement for passwords: they cannot be reused, don't leak in server breaches, and protect users from phishing attacks. They are built on open standards and work across most popular platforms and browsers such as Chrome, Android, Windows, Edge, MacOS, iOS and Safari.

  The session will cover platform support in depth, UX, implementation and using passkeys as progressive enhancement on top of current password based systems. It's relevant to both web and mobile developers and anyone working on a project with any sort of login functionality.
