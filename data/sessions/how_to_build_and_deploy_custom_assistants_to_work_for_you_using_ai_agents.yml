abstract: In this session, you will learn how to build and deploy custom assistants using AI agents. These AI assistants, tailored to specific tasks and industries, from coding to solution architecting, are designed to automate various tasks. You will learn, step by step, how to create multimodal AI agents capable of querying documentation, generating code, creating and explaining diagrams, and more. The session includes demonstrations where our generative AI agent manages a variety of tasks, significantly reducing manual effort and the potential for errors.
