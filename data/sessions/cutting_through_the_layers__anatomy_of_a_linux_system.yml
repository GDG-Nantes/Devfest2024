  Ever had to patch a critical CVE on your production systems, only to wonder
  what the affected component even does? Even the barest Linux system is actually
  composed of a plethora of independant projects, of which most users have little
  to no awareness... until something breaks. In this talk, I'll guide you through

  of how these various codebases interact with each other.
